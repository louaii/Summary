Spanning-Tree
The default port costs are defined by the speed at which the port operates (ex: 100Mbps have a port
cost of 19).
To configure the port cost of an interface:
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree cost value
value can be between 1 and 200,000,000. The port with the lowest value is selected.
To restore the port cost back to the default value of 19, enter the below command on the interface
configuration mode:
no spanning-tree cost
To change the port priority on a certain port:
SW1(config)# interface f0/4
SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan 500 port-priority 64
The port-priority value is an increment of 16 between 0 and 128, the default value is 128.
To verify the port and path cost to the root bridge:
SW1(config)# show spanning-tree
To verify the various states of a port:
SW1(config)# show spanning-tree summary
