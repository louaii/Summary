A Bastion Host is a secure entry point used to access private servers inside a network — especially in cloud environments like AWS.

🛡️ What a Bastion Host Is Used For
✔ 1. Secure SSH Access into a Private VPC

If your EC2 instances (like your Samba AD server) are inside a private subnet, you cannot SSH into them directly from the internet.

Instead, you connect to the bastion, and from there → jump to the private instance.

Your PC → Bastion Host (public) → AD Server (private)

✔ 2. Restrict Open Ports to the Internet

Without a bastion, you'd need to expose port 22 (SSH) of every server to the internet → high security risk.

With a Bastion:

Only 1 server has SSH open to the world.

All other servers have SSH blocked from the internet.

✔ 3. Logging, Monitoring, and Auditing

You can monitor:

who connects

when

what commands they run
(by using logging, CloudWatch, SSM, or other tools)

This improves compliance and audit control.

✔ 4. Protecting Sensitive Infrastructure

For environments hosting:

Active Directory

DNS

Applications

Databases

A bastion acts as a controlled security gateway.

🆚 Without Bastion vs With Bastion
❌ Without Bastion

Every server needs:

Public IP

Port 22 exposed

Higher attack surface

✔ With Bastion

Only the bastion has:

A public IP

SSH access allowed

All other servers stay private and secure.
