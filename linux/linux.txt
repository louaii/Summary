Linux is an open source os unix based on the linux kernel.

Open Source means that the code used to create free and available to the public to view edit and even contribute to its development. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

Linux component:
Bootloader: defined as the software that manages the boot process of a computer.
Kernel: core of the system that manages the CPU, memory and peripheral devices.

Init system: always executed by the Linux kernel after the early stages of boot up completion by the bootloader, it starts all the necessary daemons and background processes required to make the operating system work background processes required to make the os work.

Daemons: background services that either start up during boot or after logging in. It manages many parts of your system, such as logging information, watching for devices inserted or removed, managing user login.

Graphical Server: subsystem that displays the graphics on the monitor.

Desktop environment: users interaction and includes built-in apps.

Applications: High-quality software apps can be easily found using markets(App store, google play) to simplify application installation.

Distributions:
Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Linux Mint, OpenSUSE, Archlinux, Elementary OS.

Linux Role in DevOps: deliver software at a faster pace(building on existing infrastructure) and it's open source which makes it customizable for DevOps and flexible

System control:
systemctl start <service_name> #start service
systemctl stop <service_name> #stop service
systemctl restart <service_name>#restart
systemctl reload <service_name>#reload
systemctl enable <service_name>#enable
systemctl disable <service_name>#disable
systemctl status <service_name> #show status
systemctl poweroff    # Shutdown the system
systemctl reboot      # Reboot the system
systemctl suspend     # Suspend the system
systemctl hibernate   # Hibernate the system

Network commands:
ifconfig is used to display the parameters of wired connection interface
iwconfig is used to display the parameters of wireless connection interface
ip a(address) is used to display the system's IP networking information 
ip n(neighbour) is used to display the neighbour hosts on the network
ip r(routing) is used to display routing table showing the route packets your network will take


command -v #to check the destination of files
etc where the configuration files are located
