Kerberos is the authentication system used by Active Directory, including Samba AD.
A Kerberos test simply verifies that your domain controller can: Issue authentication tickets, Accept logins, Communicate internally through AD services

After provisioning your Samba AD domain, you run two commands:
1️⃣ kinit administrator
This command requests a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the administrator account.
You will be asked for the administrator password (the one you used during samba-tool domain provision).

If authentication works → Kerberos is functioning
If it fails → AD is not configured properly

2️⃣ Check the ticket using klist
klist


Expected output:

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0
Default principal: administrator@YOURDOMAIN.COM

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
02/15/2025 10:00:00  02/15/2025 20:00:00  krbtgt/YOURDOMAIN.COM@YOURDOMAIN.COM


This confirms:

Kerberos ticket was issued

AD authentication works

DNS + Samba AD + Kerberos integration is correct
