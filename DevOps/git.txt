Version Control System maintains track of files, helps working on a big software development project that consists of: Technical concepts, Collaborations between different team members, Frequent changes.

A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects and enables them to collaborate on those projects

Purpose of Using version control system:
.Records changes to a set of files
.Tracks every individual change by each contributor 
.Supports a developer's preference and is flexible to use
.Facilitates a smooth and continuous flow of changes of the code

Centralized version control system uses a central server to store all the files and all the changes in the files are also tracked under the centralized server

Distributed Version Control system moves from the client-server approach of the centralized version control system to a peer-to-peer approach

Git is a VCS(Version Control System) that make it easier to track changes to files, Git allows multiple developers to work together and supports non-linear development, it runs locally and uses for example as github to store a copy of the files and their revision history.Git can merge the branches so that different people can work on different parts of the same file and later merge them.

Benefits of git:
.Tracks changes in the source code
.Uses distributed version control tool for source code management
.Allows multiple developers to work together
.Supports non-linear development because of its several parallel branches
.Flexible environment
.Keep files on secure server
.Facilitates branching and merging
.Creates and manage remote repositories

Git repository contains all the project files and the entire revision history

_Git vs GitHub:

.git manage and track source code whereas github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage git repositories
.git is installed and maintained on the local system whereas github is hosted on the web
.git is command line tool github is a gui
.git is a tool to manage different versions or a file in a git repository, github provides a web-based git repository to upload files

git commands:
git config --global user.name username //to set username
git config --global user.email email@example.com //to set email
git init //to initiate .git file in new file with in a new repository
git clone repository //to clone an existing remote repository
git status //to check the status and the difference between the working directory and the commited area
git add filename //to add the file in the commiting area before commiting the changes
git rm filename //to remove the file in the commiting area before commiting the changes
git commit -m "message" //to commit the changes in the commiting area before pushing with a note
git pull // to get all the changes from the commiting area to the working directory
git push //to push the commited file to the repository
git remote add origin <server_name> //to connect working directory to the repository
