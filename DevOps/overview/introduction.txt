DevOps is a set of tools and practices, designed to shorten the software development lifecycle process.
The DevOps way of working: faster deployment, stabilized work environment, significant improvement product quality, automation of repetitive tasks.
Tools for DevOps: Git, CI/CD jenkis, Selenium, Ansible, Docker, Nagios, Kubernetes.
Requirements for DevOps:
.Basic linux commands useful for the project development.

.Git(version control system) software for tracking changes in any set of files usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code.

.Jenkis is an open-source automation server, that helps automate parts of software development and support continuous integration and delivery.

.Selenium which is a portable framework to conduct automation testing for web applications to embed different test cases.

.Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine to automate cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and a variety of other IT tasks enabling infrastructure as a code.

.Docker is a platform as a service to create and deploy files more quickly and securely. Docker is a platform as a service product that delivers software in containers using OS-level virtualization. Containers are self-contained, containing their own software libraries and configuration files. They communicate with each other via well-defined channels.

.Nagios is an open-source continuous monitoring tool used to monitor system, network, IT infrastructure.

.Kubernetes is open-source orchestration platform designed to manage containerized applications.
