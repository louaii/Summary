Jenkins is used for fast software delivery(CI/CD), it allows automating repetitive tasks and reducing human errors, easily integrates with various tools improving workflow and collaboration between teams

Agile: Plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor

CI: Continuous integration - CD: Continuous Delivery

 
Continuous Integration:
Software development practice that requires team members to integrate their work frequently, the goal of CI is to detect and fix integration issues early which is achieved by automating software testing and building everytime a team member pulses changes to the code repo


Continuous Deployment/Delivery:
Once the app is built it must be deployed in a testing environment and finally deliver it to production, it can be implemented automatically or manually


Pre-staging --> functional and performance --> deploy --> manual/automatic --> production and monitor
