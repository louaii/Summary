Feature	IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)				POP3 (Post Office Protocol)
Storage	Emails stay on the server. Syncs across devices.		Emails are downloaded to one device and usually deleted from the server.
Access	Access from multiple devices (Outlook, phone, webmail).		Emails are stored only on the device that downloaded them.
Syncing	Changes (read, delete, move) sync across all devices.		Changes do NOT sync across devices.
