Incident: An occurance without authority, confidentiality, integrity or availability of information constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures or acceptable use policies

Event: An observable occurence on a system, network or device

5W's of an incident:
who triggered that incident
what happened
when the incident took place
where the incident took place
why the incident occured

Incident handler's journal: A form of documentation used on incident response

CSIRT(Computer Security Incident Response Teams): A specialized group of security professionals that are trained in incident management and response

Roles in CSIRT: Security Analyst, Technical Lead, Incident Coordinator

Clements of Security Plan: Policies, Standards, Procedures

Incident Response Plan: A document that outlines the procedures to take in each step of incident response

Elements of an incident plan: Incident response procedures, system information, other documents

Tools: Detection and management tools, Documentation tools, Investigate tools

Documentation: Any form of recorded content that is used for a specific purpose

Types of documentation: Playbooks, Incident handler's journals, policies, plans, find reports

(IOC): Indicators of compromise: Observate evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident

Data exfiltration: unauthorized transmission of data from a system

Rivoting: taking a sneaky access on a machine for a long time

Defensive measures: Prevent attacker access, Monitor network activity, Protect assets, Detect and stop the exfiltration

Components of a packet:
Header: port and network protocol - source/dest ip
Payload: data being delivered
Footer: end of packet

Packet ipv4 header:
Version IHL Tos TotalLength Identification Flags Fragement offset TTL Protocol Header checker Source IP Destination IP

Version: IPv4 / IPv6 
IHL ==> Internet Header Length: Specifies the length of IP header
Tos ==> Type of service notifies certain packets should be treated with different care
Total Length: Length of active packet including header and data
Identification - Flags - Fragement offset: Deal with info related to fragementation (when ip packet gets broken into chunks which get transmitted over the wire abd reassembled when they arrive at their destination they specify if fragementation has been used and how to reassemble the broken packets in the correct order)
Time To Live(TTL): how long a packet can live before it gets dropped
Protocol:Specifies the protocol used by providing value ex: TCP as 6
Header checksum: Stores checksum value to determine if any errors occurs
Source ip: Sender ip
Dest ip: destination ip


IPv6 Header:
Version IPv6
Traffic class like ToS(ipv4) provides info about the packet's priority
Flow label: identifies the packets of a flow which is a sequence of packets sent from a specific source
Payload length: Specifies the length of data portion of the packet
Next header: indicates type of protocol ex: TCP
Hop limit: as TTL
Source IP
Dest IP

TCPdump: sudo tcpdump -i any -v -c 1
-i interface 
-v verbose
-c count

Detection: the prompt discovery of search events
Analysis: The investigation and violation of alerts
Chain of custody: The process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle => establish: Integrity, Reliability, Accurarcy
Broken chainof custody: Inconsistencies in the collection and logging of evidence in the chain of custody
Triage: The priotizing of incidents according to their level of importance or ugency (Ransomeware > Phishing email)
Triage process: Recieve and assess, Assign Priority, Collect and analyze
Containment: The act of limiting and preventing additional damage caused by an incident
Eradication: The complete removal of incident elements from all affected systems
Recovery: The process of returning affected systems back to normal operations
Post-incident activity phase: The process of reviewing an incident to identify areas for improvement during incident handling
Final report: Documentation that provides a comprehensive review of an incident
Telementry: The collection and transmission of data for analysis
Host-based intrusion detection system: An application that monitors the activity of the host on which it's installed
Network-Based intrusion detection system: An application that collects and monitors network traffic and network data
Signature analysis: A detection method used to find events of interest
SPL(Search Processing Language): Splunk's query language
YARA-L: A computer language used to create rules for searching through ingested log data
