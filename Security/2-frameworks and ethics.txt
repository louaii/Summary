Security frameworks:
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data privacy

Purpose of security frameworks:
_Protecting PII
_Security financial information
_Identifying security weakness
_Managing organizational risks
_Aligning security with business guides

Components of security frameworks:
_Identifying and documenting security goals
_Setting guidlines to achieve security goals
_Implementing security process
_Monitoring and communicating results

Security controls:
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

CIA Triad: Foundational cybersecurity model
A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies
_Confidentiality: only authorized users can access specific assets or data
_Integrity: data is correct, authentic and reliable
_Availability: data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it

NIST RMF(NIST risk management framework):
A voluntary framework that consists of standards guidlines and best practices to manage risks

NIST S.P.800-63: 
A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government

NIST Core Functions:
_Identity: The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on a organization's people and assets
_Protect: The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cyber threats
_Detect: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
_Respond: Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyse security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process
_Recover: The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation

NIT RMF steps:
1.Prepare: activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
2.Categorize: used to develop risk management tasks(CIA Triad)
3.Select: choose documentation of controls that protect an organization
3.Implement: implement privacy plans for the organization
5.Assess: determine if established controls are implemented correctly
6.Authorize: Being accountable for risks that may exist in firm
7.Monitor: Be aware of how systems operating

Asset: An item perceived as having value to an organization(PC)

NIST cybersecurity framework: known as NIST CSF is a valuntary framework that consists of standards, guidlines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

CIS: Center of internet risk
GDPR: General data protection regulation
PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry data security standards
HIPAA: Health insurance portability and accountability act (Privacy, Security, Branch Information)
ISO: International Organization for standardization

Ethics:
Guidlines for making appropriate desicions as a security professional
ethical principles in security:
_confidentiality
_privacy protection: safeguard personal information from unauthorised use
_law: rules recognized by a community enforced by a governing entity

Tools and programming languages:
_Log: A record of events that occur within an organization's systems
_SIEM tool(Security Information and event management): An app that collects and analyses log data to monitor critical activities in an organization(Splunk, chronicle)
==> Splunk enterprise: a data analysis platform, provides SIEM solutions, it's self-hosted tool used to vetain, analyze and search an organization's log data.
==> Google chronicle: is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. It allows fast delivery of new features
_Network protocol analyzer(packet sniffer): A tool designed to capture data traffic within network(tcpdump and wireshark)
_Risk mitigation: having the right procedures and rules in place quickly reduce the impcat of a risk like a breach
_Risk: Analyzing that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of asset(lack of backup)
_Vulnerability: a weakness that can be exploited by a threat
_Risk assessment: risk description, control best practices


Frameworks and Controls:
.Frameworks: guidlines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data privacy(social engineering and ransomeware) and they provide for how to prevent, detect and respond to attacks and risks.

.Controls: safeguards to reduce specific security risks(encryption, authentication, authorization)

.Encryption: The process of converting data from a vendable format to an encoded format(converting from plain text to cipher text)

.Authentication: The process of verifying who someone or something is (login into website using username and password), more to identify the user is multifactor authentication and biometrics(unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity)

.Authorization: The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system

OWASP Security tools:(Open web and security projects)
.Minimize attack surface area(Phishing)
.Principle of least privilige
.Defense in depth(Multi factor authentication)
.Seperation of duties
.Keep Security simple
.Fix Security issues correctly

_Minimize attack surface area:
Attack surface area refers to all the potential vulnerabilities and threat actor could exploit

_Principle of least privilige:
users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.

_Defense in depth: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats

_Seperation of duties: Critical actions that should rely on multiple people, each of who follow the principle of least privilige.

_Keep security simple: Avoid unnecessairly complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.

_Fix security issues correctly: when security incidents occur, identify vulnerabilities and conduct tests to ensure that remedication is successful

Security audit:
A review of an organization's security controls, policies, procedures against a sort of exceptions(internal or external)

Purposes of internal security audits:
_Identify organizational risk
_Assess controls
_Correct compliance issue

Common elements of internal audits:
_Establish the scope and goals
Scope: Specific critirea of internal audit
Goals: Outline of the organization's security objectives
_Conducting a risk assessment
Risk assessment: risk observation, control best practices
_Completing a control assessment
_Assessing Compliance
_Communicating results

Audits Questions:
What is the audit meant to achieve?
Which assets are most at risk?
Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
What controls and compliance regulations need to implemented?

Controls: Administrive(password/policies), technical(IDS/Encryption), physical(locks/CCTV survelliance)
CCTV: Closed Circuit Television Survellience

Stakeholder Communication:
_Summarize scope and goals
_List existing risks
_Notes how quickly those risks need to be addressed
_Identifies compliance regulations
_Provides recommendations

Logs:
A record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks(firewalls, Network, Server)

.Firewall Log: 
A record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network

.Network Log:
A record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network

.Server Log:
A record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or files shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests

.Metrics:
Key technical attributes, such as response time, availability, failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application

.SOAR(Security Orchestration, automation, response): A collection of apps, tools and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events.

Playbooks to respond to incidents:
_Playbook: A manual that provides details about any operational action for urgency, efficiency and accuracy to quickly identify the threat
_Incident response: An organization's quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach


Incident response six steps:
_Preparation: Organization's must prepare to mitigate risk and impact of a security incidentby documenting procedures, establishing, staffing plans and edcating users. It sets incident response
_Detection and analysis: using defined processes and technology. Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase helps security analysts determine wether a breach has occured and analyze its possible magnitude
_Contaiment: is to prevate further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident, security professionals take actions to contain an incident and minimize damage. It helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data.
_Eradication and recovery: involves the complete removal of an incident's artifacts so that a organization can return to normal operations. Security professionals eliminate artifacts of the incident log removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities. Once done they can restore the affected environment to a secure state
_Post-incident activity: documenting the incident, informing organizational leadership, and applying lessons learned to ensure that the organization is better prepared to handle future incidents.
_Coordination: involves reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process, based on the organization's established standards.
