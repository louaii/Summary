CVE list criteria:
_Independent of other issues
_Recognized as a potential security risk
_Submitted with supporting evidence
_Only affect one codebase

CVSs(Common Vulnerability Scoring System): A measurement system that scores the severity of a vulnerability
Attack surface: All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit
Security hardening: the process of strengthing a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface
Attack vector: The pathways that attackers use to penetrate security defense

Practicing an attacker mindset:
_Identify a target
_Determine how the target could be accessed
_Evaluate attacker vectors that can be exploited
_Find the tools and method of an attack

Defending attacker vectors:
_Educating users
_Applying the principle of least privilige
_Using the right security controls and tools
_Building a diverse security team

Reflected XSS attack: An instance when malicious script is sent to a server and activated during the server's response
Stored XSS attack: An instance when malicious script is injected directly on the server
DOM-based XSS attack: An instance when malicious script exists in the webpage a browser loads
SQL injection: An attack that executes unexpected queries on database
Prepared statement: A coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on database
Threat modeling: The process of identifying of assets vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats(1.Define scope, 2.Identify threats, 3.Characterize environment, 4.Analyze threat, 5.Mitigate risk, 6.Evaluate findings)
Attack Tree: A diagram That maps threats to assets
PASTA(Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis): A popular threat modeling framework that is used across way industries
1.Define business and security objectives 2.Define Technical Scope 3.Decompose the application 4.Perform a threat analysis 5.Perform a vulnerability analysis 6.Conduct attack modeling 7.Analyze risk and impact
