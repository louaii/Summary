TCP/IP model: A framework used to visualize how data are organized and transmitted across the network 
IP(Internet Protocol): Asset of standard used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network
TCP(Transmission control protocol):Internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data
Port: A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network
Data Packet: A basic unit of info that travels from one device to another within a network

Bandwidth: The amount of data a device receives every second
Speed: The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded

IEEE 802.11(wifi): A set of standards that define communication for wireless Local Area Networks
Wifi protocol access(WPA): A wireless security protocol for devices to connect to the internet
Firewall: A network security device that monitors traffic to and from by our network
Port filtering: A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication
cloud based firewalls: Software firewalls that are hosted by a cloud service provider
stateful firewall: A class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats
stateless firewall: A class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and does not keep track of information from data packets
Next generation firewall: Application layer
VPN: Virtual private network security service that changes your IP and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you are using a public network
Encapsulation: A process performed by VPN service that protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets
Security Zone: A segment of a network that protects the internal network from the internet
Network Segmentation: A security technique that divides the network into segments
Internet -> firewall -> DMZ -> firewall -> internal network -> firewall -> restricted zone ==> Security Architecture
Proxy: A server that fulfills the request of client by forwarding them on to other
Forward Proxy: Regulates and restricts a person's access to the internet
Reverse proxy: Regulates and restricts the internet's accross to an internal server


Hacks that can harm an organization:
Leaking valuable or confidential info
Damaging an organization's repetition
Impacting customer reflection
Costing money and time

Dos(Denial of service): An attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic which costs money, time and leave them vulnerable to other attack

Distributed denial of service attack DDoS: A type of denial of service attack that uses multiple devices or servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic

Three Common network level DDoS attacks:
SYN(synchronization) flood attack: A type of DoS attack that simulates a TCP connection and floods a server with SYN Packets
Sends SYN receives SYN/ACK and stops without sending ACK to the server so the tcp connection won't establish with the 3 way handshake

ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol): An internet Protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network

ICMP flood attack: A type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP packets to a network server as Ping of death that sends ICMP packets bigger than standard size (64KB)

Passive Packet sniffing: A type of attack where data packets are read in transmit

Active packet sniffing: A type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transmit

Prevent packet sniffing:
VPN
HTTPS(SSL/TLS)
Avoid using unprotected wifi

ip spoofing: on path attack, smurf attack
A network attack performed when an attacker changes the source ip of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to network

On-Path attack: An attack where a malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts the data in transmit(man in the middle)

Smurf attack: A network attack performed when an attack sniffs an authorized user's ip and floods it with packets

Protect against ip spoofing:
VPN
Firewall(configure it to stop traffic when an outcoming packet has the same ip on the local network)
