Security hardening:
The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface

Attack Surface:
All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit

Penetration test:
A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, apps and processes

Operating System:
Interface between computer hardware and the user

Patch updates:
A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product

Baseline configuration(image): A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases and updates

Multifactor Authentication:
A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network

Network security hardening:
Port filtering: A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication
Network access privilege
Encryption

Tasks performed:
Firewall rules maintenance
Network log analysis
Patch updates
Server Backups

Devices:
Firewalls:
Advantages:
allows or blocks traffic based on a set of rules 
Disadvantages:
only able to filter packets based on info provided in the header of the packets

IDS:
Advantage:
detects and alerts admin about possible intrusion, attack and other malicious traffic
Disadvantages:
only seams for known attacks or obvious anomalies, new and sophisticated attacks might not be caught. It doesn't actually stop incoming traffic


IPS:
Advantage:
monitors system activity for intrusions and anomalies and takes actions to stop them
Disadvantages:
Fail if connection lost between private network and internet also it might detect false positives and block legitimate traffic
