            Frequency: Select a frequency (default: auto or a specific one like 2412 MHz for 2.4 GHz).
        Click OK.

Step 2: Secure the Wi-Fi

    Create a Security Profile:
        Go to Wireless → Security Profiles → Click +.

        Go back to wlan1 settings.
        Under the Wireless tab:
            Security Profile: Select WiFiSecure.

Step 6: Save Configuration

    Go to System → Backup → Save the configuration to ensure changes are not lost.
