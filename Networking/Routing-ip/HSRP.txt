Hot Standby Router Protocol is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol designed to ensure high availability and reliability of network services in a local area network
 (LAN). It multiple routers to work together to present the appearance of a single virtual router to the network. The protocol provides automatic failover and load balancing between routers,
 which helps maintain uninterrupted network service in case one of the routers fails.

HSRP priority and preemption
.Role of active and standby routers determined by election process
.By default, the router with the numerically highest IPv4 address is elected as the active router
.Control HSRP election with priority and do not use highest address

_Priority:
 .used to determine active router
 .Default HSRP priority is 100
 .Range is 0 to 255 and router with highest priority will become active

_HSRP Preemption:
 .ability of HSRP router to trigger the re-election process
