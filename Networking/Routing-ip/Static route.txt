Static routing is used in small, stub networks and Default route.
A router access other remote networks in two ways:
.Manually: Less Overhaed, increase with network size, More secure
.Dynamically: More Overhead, Independent from network size

Default Static Route:
.used to forward traffic that doesn't have an entry in the routing
table(Internet) and also used on Stub Router.

Stub routers and Stub networks:
.A router with one exit interface is called stub router
.A network with one interface to the routed topology is called a stub
network

Notes of static routing:
.Multiple static routes can be summarized into a 
single network address
.Destination networks must be contiguous
.Multiple static routes must use the same exit interface or next hop

Floating Static Routes:
.Backup path used when primary route is not available
.Primary route is determined by the one with the lowest 
 Administrative Distance by default 1.
.Any higher Administritive Distance route pointing to same destination
 network will be considered as floating route. 
ip route 192.168.6.0 255.255.255.0 fa0/1 2
ip route: command of static routing
192.168.6.0: ip of next network
255.255.255.0: subnet mask of next network
fa0/1: exit interface facing the next network's router is fa0/1
2: is the floating route in case primary route failed
for primary route keep it empty:
ip route 192.168.5.0 255.255.255.0 fa0/0
