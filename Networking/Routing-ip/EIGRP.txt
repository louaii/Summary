Enhanced Interior  Gateway Routing Protocol(EIGRP)
.Cisco proprietary
.Classless Protocol
.RTP protocol to exchange EIGRP packets
.DUAL protocol as routing algorithm
.Ideal for large networks
.Supports ipv4 and ipv6
.EIGRP administrative distance is equal to 5
.EIGRP uses multicast address to send traffic
.EIGRP packet 224.0.0.5 or 224.0.0.6
.EIGRP frame 01-00-5E-00-00-0F
.All routers exchanging routing information between them belong to a unique Autonomous System(AS)

EIGRP Packets: Hello, Update, Query, Reply, Acknowledge
.Hello Packets:
 .used to discover other EIGRP routers in the network
 .Hello packet are sent each 5 seconds, over ethernet and serial links
 .Sent UNRELIABLY to multicast address

.Acknowledgement Packets:
 .Used to acknowledge the receipt of any EIGRP packet:Update, Query, Reply
 .Sent UNRELIABLY as unicasts

.Update Packets:
 .Convey routing information to know destinations
 .Sent RELIABLY as unicasts or multicasts

.Query Packets:
 .Used to get specific information from a neighbor router
 .Sent RELIABLY as umicasts or multicasts

.Reply Packets:
 .Used to respond to a query
 .Sent RELIABILITY as unicasts

EIGRP Metric:
.Each dynamic routing protocol consider the path that has the lowest cost to reach the destination network
.The cost is determined based on metric considered by the routing protocol
.EIGRP consider a composite metric to determine the path cost:
  _Min Bandwidth: The lowest bandwidth between source and destination
  _Delay: The cumulative interface delay along the path
  _Reliability(Optional): Worst reliability between source and destination
  _Load(Optional): Worst load on a link between source and destination

EIGRP Metric calculation formula = {[(10^7)/Min Bandwidth] + [(Sum delays out interfaces)/10]}

EIGRP DUAL:
EIGRP uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to provide best and backup loop
Feasible Distance: It is the path that has the lowest Metric to reach the destination network, used in the routing table
Reported Distance: It is reported metric from the neighbor advertising the route
Successor: It is a neighboring router that is used for packet forwarding that has the least cost route to the destination network.
Feasible successor: These are the Backup paths taht are a loop-free. Must comply to a feasibility condition:
Reported Distance(neighbor) < Feasible Distance(selected router).

EIGRP Tuning:
 
.EIGRP Auto-Summarization:
 .EIGRP automatically recognizes subnets as a single class A, B or Cnetworks creates only one entry in the routing table for the summary route.
 .Automatic summarization is disabled by default for EIGRP ipv4

.Routing loops(Auto summary enabled)
 .Always be aware of contiguous networks while enabling Automatic summarization to avoid routing loops.
 .EIGRP uses the NULL0 interface to prevent types of routing loops
 
.Bandwidth Utilization:
 .EIGRP uses only up to 50 percent of an interface's bandwidth for EIGRP information(changeable through config)
