Enhanced Interior  Gateway Routing Protocol(EIGRP)
.Cisco proprietary
.Classless Protocol
.RTP protocol to exchange EIGRP packets
.DUAL protocol as routing algorithm
.Ideal for large networks
.Supports ipv4 and ipv6
.EIGRP administrative distance is equal to 5
.EIGRP uses multicast address to send traffic
.EIGRP packet 224.0.0.5 or 224.0.0.6
.EIGRP frame 01-00-5E-00-00-0F
.All routers exchanging routing information between them belong to a unique Autonomous System(AS)
