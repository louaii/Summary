(RIP)Routing Information Protocol:
.Distance Vector Protocol
.Bellman-Ford Algorithm
.Hello Keep Alive Packets(30s)
.Metric: Hop Count as max 15 if 16 considered as network unreachable
.Administrative Distance 120
.RIPv1 => Classful(doesn't share the subnet mask of the current network to neighbour routers)
.RIPv2 => Classless(shares the subnet mask of the current network to neighbour routers)
