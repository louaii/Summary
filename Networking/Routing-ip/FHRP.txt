First Hop Redundancy Protocols
Router Redundancy:
.To prevent a single point of failure at the default gateway, implement a virtual router
.ARP resolution returns the MAC address of the virtual router
.Ability of network to dynamically recover from the failure of a device acting as a default gateway is known as first hop redundancy

Switch connected to virtual router and then packets are redirected to the working router in case of Active or Backup
Active router is choosed based on election(the active router can become a backup router in case of adding or changing router on the network)
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol(VRRP) version 1 and 3
Gateway Load Balancing Protocol(GLBP)
Hot Standby router Protocol(HSRP) version 1 and 2
