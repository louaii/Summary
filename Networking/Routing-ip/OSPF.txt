Open Shortest Path First(OSPF): protocol that uses a mathematical algorithm to calculate the most efficient path to direct traffic on IP networks
OSPF characteristics:
.IGP(Works within a single ISP)
.Link State Protocol
.It uses Dijkstra Algorithm to choose the best path
.Default Administrative Distance 110
.Single Area and Multi Area OSPF
.Classless, Secure, Efficient, Scalable, Fast convergence

OSPF Messages:
.OSPF uses Multicast Address 224.0.0.5 or 224.0.0.6
.Type of OSPF Messages (packets)
  .Hello Packets: used to discover OSPF neighbors, election, sent every 10s to links, router OSPF considered dead if no hello packets recieved 4 times. 
  .Database Description(DBD): Checks for database synchronization between routers(LSDB)
  .Link State Request(LSR): Requests specific link-state records from router to router
  .Link State Update(LSU): Consists of 11 LSAs
	LSA Type	|	Description
	   1			Router LSAs
	   2		        Network LSAs
	 3 or 4                 Summary LSAs
	   5               Autonomous System External
				   LSAs
	   6                  Multicast OSPF LSAs

  .Link State Acknowledgment(LSAck): Link state acknowledgment acknowledges the reception of LSDB and LSU packets
