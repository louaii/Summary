Dynamic Protocols ==> Interior Gateway Protocol ===> (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS_IS)
		     		  Exterior Gateway Protocol ===> BGP

Dynamic Routing Protocol Purpose:
.Discovery of remote networks
.Maintaining up to date routing information
.Choosing the best path to destination networks
.Ability to find a new best path if the current path is no longer available

Dynamic routing is the best choice for large networks

Dynamic routing protocol components:
.Data Structures: tables or databases kept in RAM
.Routing protocols messages: to discover neighnoring routers, exchange routing information, and
 maintain accurate information about the network.
.Algorithms: to facilitate learning routing information and for best path determination
