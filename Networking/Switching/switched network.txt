Switched network is a converged network as data, voice over ip, video as NVR to have:
 security, reliability, availability and borderless network to extand range.

Cisco has 3 layers in switching:
.Core layer: Layer that traverses data between internet and below layers from users
.Distribution layer: Layers that distributes data from the core layer to the below 
 layer reaching the destinated users
.Access layer: Layer that directly connected to users

Hierarchy switched network:
.Hierarchial: Facilitates understanding the role of each device at every tire
.Modularity: Allows seamless network expansion and integrated services
.Resiliency: Provides an always available network
.Flexibility: Allows intelligent traffic load sharing

The switching process:

.A LAN switch makes decisions based on two criteria:
_Ingress port(where a frame enters the device)
_Destination address

.A LAN switch maintains a table that it uses to determine how to forward traffic:
_Maps between Ingress port and Destination physical address

.Forwarding methods:
_Store and Forward(Error checking)
_Cut through(No error checking)

Switch Port Modes:
.Access
.Trunk
.Dynamic Auto
.Dynamic Desirable
