Spanning Tree Protocol: is used to stop network failing in case a switch down and have a failover (redundant) link
Block redundant ports to avoid loops using STP

Reasons of using STP:
.MAC Database instability
.Multiple frame transmission
.Broadcast Storms

STP:Avoiding loops
.STP created one logical path to all other switches in the network
.This creation is done by sending BPDU frames(802.1D) between switches to create these logical links
.The creation of the logical links is done based on:
 _Root Bridge Election
 _Port Designation

Type of switches in an STP domain:
.Root Bridge
.Secondary Root Bridge
.Non Root Bridge

Root Bridge Election:
.The election of the Root Bridge switch is done based on the one that has the lowest Bridge ID (BID)
.The BID consists of 2 parts ==> Priority(32,768[Default]) | Mac Address


.Root Path:
The root path is the path that has the lowest cost to other switches from the Root Bridge

Root Path Cost:
The cost of a path is determined based on the interfaces ports types and speed
.10Gb/s ==> 2
.1Gb/s ==> 4
.100Mb/s ==> 19
.10Mb/s ==> 100

Port Roles:
.Designated Ports
.Root Port
.Alternate Port(Non-Designated Port)

Port Roles
.All ports of the root bridge facing other switches in the stp domain are considered as Designated Ports
.All ports facing of the switches in the ingress direction over the root path are considered as Root ports
.All ports facing a port in a blocking state are considered as designated ports.
.All ports that belongs to the switch that has the highest BID on a blocked link are considered as Alternate Ports.
.3 missed BPDUs indicates lost connectivity
