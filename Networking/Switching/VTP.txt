Vlan Trunking Protocol is a normal range vlan management from switch that has three types:
.VTP server: where the configs are set
.VTP client: automatically pulls the configs from the VTP server
.VTP transparent: trunk port and works to transfer data between vtp server and client
and all the above switches require the same VTP Domain and Domain name, version and password to access each other

VTP revision number:
.With each update(Creating new Vlans, Deleting Vlans) the revision number will be increased
.Server Switch with high revision number will impose its Vlan database to other switches to the same domain
.Make sure to reset the revision number of a newly joining switch before adding it to the domain
