Intervlan routing is the key of communication between devices on different vlans
Layer 2 switches cannot forward traffic between vlans without the assistance of a router
Intervlan routing is a process for forwarding network traffic from one vlan to another using router
Intervlan routing options:
.Legacy intervlan routing: router connected to 2 interfaces each interface belongs to the different vlan
.Router on a stick: router connected to a single interface and seperates the vlans in sub interfaces
.Layer 3 switching using SVIs: layer 3 switches can have ip address for vlans so they can access each other over ip
