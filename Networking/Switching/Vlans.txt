.Security 
.Cost reduction
.Smaller Broadcast Domains
.Simpler Projects

Vlans types:

.Data Vlans: are commonly created for specific groups of users or devices which they carry user generated traffic
 _Normal range Vlans: from 1 to 1005, configs stored in the vlan.dat in the flash memory
 _Extended range Vlans: vlan numbers from 1006 to 4096, configs stored in the running configs in NVRAM
.Native Vlan: carries all untagged user generated traffic(STP,BPDU), Vlan 1 is the native Vlan set by default 
.Management Vlan: created to carry network management traffic including SSH,SNMP,Syslog also Vlan 1 is the default management network Vlan
.Voip Vlan: To support time-sensitive voice traffic
