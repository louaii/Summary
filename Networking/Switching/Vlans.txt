Vlans can segment LAN devices (Layer2) without regard for the physical location of the user-device.

Benefits of Vlans:
.Security 
.Cost reduction
.Smaller Broadcast Domains
.Simpler Projects

Vlans types:
.Default Vlan: Known as Vlan 1, that all switch ports are member of Vlan 1 by default
.Data Vlans: are commonly created for specific groups of users or devices which they carry user generated traffic
 _Normal range Vlans: from 1 to 1005, configs stored in the vlan.dat in the flash memory
 _Extended range Vlans: vlan numbers from 1006 to 4096, configs stored in the running configs in NVRAM
.Native Vlan: carries all untagged user generated traffic(STP,BPDU), Vlan 1 is the native Vlan set by default 
.Management Vlan: created to carry network management traffic including SSH,SNMP,Syslog also Vlan 1 is the default management network Vlan
.Voip Vlan: To support time-sensitive voice traffic
 _Assured bandwidth
 _Delay of less than 150ms across the network to ensure voice quality
 _Transmission priority over other types of network traffic
 _Ability to be routed around congested areas on the network

Vlans Trunk is a point to point link that carries more than one Vlan, usually established between switches to support intra Vlan communication,
 a Vlan trunk or trunk ports are not associated to any Vlans

Tagging Ethernet frames for Vlan identification
.Before a frame is forwarded across a trunk link, it must be tagged with its Vlan information
.IEEE 802.1q is a very popular Vlan trunking protocol that defines the structure of the tagging header added to the frame

Native Vlans and 802.1q tagging
.Control traffic sent on the native Vlan should not be tagged
.Frames received untagged, remain untagged and are placed in the native Vlan when forwarded
.Native Vlans must match between switches
