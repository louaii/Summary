NAT:
Public ips are assigned from internet service providers(ISP)s to be able to connect to the internet meanwhile,
 this public ip is set for each house as a single ip and translated through network address translation(nat) or
 port address translation(pat) to provide an ip for each device on the network as a private ip and each one of those
 refers a single ip address which is the public ip.

Classes:
Each IP address refers to a class depending of the needs of alive hosts which means if an enterprise of
 700 employees, will nat their network to a class A network ==> 10.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx
								    1=>255   1=>255   1=>255
 otherwise if there is 500 employees in a firm, the IT department will choose the class B translation as:
			172.16.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx
				1=>255   1=>255
 or if a firm of 200 employees, the usage of CLass C is the best:
		192.168.1.xxxxxxxx
			   1=>255
