TCP stands for transmission control protocol that sends 
 the packet in an ordered way and makes sure that the packet is fully sent, otherwise UPD stands for 
 User Datagram Protocol and it's used for live streaming and calls to send the packet in a faster way
 regardless if sent properly with it's data.

The main work of tcp is the three way handshake between two devices
The first step is sending a SYN packet from the device trying to establish connection on the other device.
After recieving the second device the SYN packet, it's turn now to send back a SYN/ACK packet as an acknowledge
for the transmission of packets.
The last step to establish a tcp connection is sending back from the first device an ACK packet to acknowledge
that the SYN/ACK packet is recieved.
