_A Record (Address Record): Points your domain to your email server’s IP address.
mail.example.com → 192.168.1.10

_CNAME Record: for webmail or mail services
webmail.example.com → mail.example.com

_MX Record (Mail Exchanger Record): Specifies the mail server responsible for receiving emails for your domain.
example.com → mail.example.com (priority: 10)

_PTR Record (Reverse DNS - optional but recommended): Maps your IP back to your domain (needed for outgoing mail to avoid spam filters).
192.168.1.10 → mail.example.com

_SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework - TXT Record): Defines which mail servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of your domain
v=spf1 ip4:192.168.1.10 -all

_DKIM Record (DomainKeys Identified Mail - TXT Record): Adds a cryptographic signature to verify email authenticity.
default._domainkey.example.com → "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"

_DMARC Record (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance - TXT Record):
Protects against spoofing by enforcing SPF and DKIM policies.
_dmarc.example.com → "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@example.com"

for mail:
Ensure your MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are correct


DKIM is an email security standard designed to make sure that an email is not altered in transit between the sender and recipient server.

It uses an approach called “public-key cryptography” to verify that an email message was sent from an authorized mail server, and makes sure that the email delivered is an authentic one and no alterations were made to it in transit.

steps for mail:
1.mx
2.spf as txt
3.dkim as txt
