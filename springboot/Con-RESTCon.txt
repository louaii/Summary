*Controller is used to define a standard Spring MVC to render views in web applications, Methods in a @Controller return view names, which are resolved by a ViewResolver to render an HTML Page, for returning data you need to annotate methods with @ResponseBody

@Controller //MVC controller to handle web requests
public class myController {
	
	@GetMapping("/hello") //maps http GET request to the /hello page on web
	public String sayHello(Model model) {
		/*
			Adds an attribute "message" with the value "Hello" to the Model
			This data will be accessible in the view
		*/
		model.addAttribute("message", "Hello");
		return "hello"; //returns the name of the view
	}

	@GetMapping("/api/data") //Maps http GET requests for "/api/data" page on web
	@ResponseBody //Indicates that the return value should be written directly to the HTTP response
	public String getData() {
		//Returns plain text or JSON as the response body as string
		return "Data as plain text or JSON";
	}
}
