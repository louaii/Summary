A component is a class that is managed by the Spring Inversion of Control Container.

@Component marks a class as a Spring-managed bean that will be detected and registered as a bean during classpath scanning and it's a generic component(general) that has no specific role indicated(any custom logic that doesn't fall under a specific layer can be marked as component)

.Spring creates, configures, and manages the lifecycle of component instances
.Components can be injected into other components using annotations like @Autowired or constructor injection 
.Once registered, components become accessible to other beans in the Spring Container
