{Controller Layer(Request)}
REST(Respresentational State Transfer) is not a standard or a protocol, it's an architectural style for distributed systems that relies on stateless communication, typically over HTTP that allows systems to be scalable, simple and loosely coupled.

.HTTP Methods:
GET: Retrieve data - get data.
POST: Submit data
PUT: Update data
DELETE: Remove data

.Statelessness:
Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, the server doesn't store any client context between requests.

.Representation:
Resources can be represented in different formats such as JSON,XML, or plain text. The client and server exchange these representations to perform operations.

.Uniform Interface:
REST defines a uniform and consistent interface for interacting with resources:
 Resource identification through URLs and Standard HTTP methods and status codes(200-OK, 404-Not found, 201-created)

.Layered System:
REST allows for intermediate layer such as load balancers or proxies without affecting the client-server interaction
