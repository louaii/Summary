--> Routing Protocol Authentication:

_Used to prevent injection of false routes and some DoS/DDoS attacks:

Clear-text authentication is not a security tool.
Stronger authentication methods rely on HMAC functions
A calculated hash is appended to the routing protocol packet

_RIPv2:

Supported authentication methods include clear-text and MD5
Requires a Key Chain (key-chain). Apply with ip rip authentication[key-chain|mode]

_Key chains allow for simplified key rotation:

Updates will be only accepted during accept-lifetime period
Updates will be sent within send-lifetime period

_EIGRP:

Supports MD5 and SHA-256(Named Mode)authentication
Similar to RIP, a Key Chain is used to define a shared key
Configure with [ip] authentication [key-chain|mode]

_OSPF:

Supports MD5 and SHA-256 authentication
Configuration syntax depends on IOS version
ip ospf authentication message-digest + ip ospf message-digest-key
Key chain defines a crypto algorithm and key: cryptographic-algorithm
Enable authentication with ip ospf authentication key-chain

_BGP:

The only available authentication method is MD5(neighbor ipv4 addr password)


--> Route Filtering:
_The ability to control routes advertised to a neighbor or routing process:

Reduces the size of routing tables(save memory)
Used as a security tool(traffic separation)
Allows for traffic engineering

_Hiding routing info is not always beneficial:
Lack of redundancy
