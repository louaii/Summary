Identity Services Engine(ISE): Next-generation Identity Management system similar to ACS but much more powerful such as:
_Context-based access
_Network visibility
_Centralied policy enforcement
_Guest & endpoint management

ISE available as a physical or virtual appliance as a:
_ 1 RU 3600-series Secure Network Server (SNS)
_VMware ESXi/Red Hat KVM/Microsoft Hyper-V software image

ISE Main Features (2.4):
_Centralized Management & AAA: (Flexible rule-based, Radius & Tacacs+ as AAA protocols, external databases)
_Profiling
_BYOD
_Guest Services
_Posture Assessment
_TrustSec
_Platform Exchange Grid (pxGrid) Integration
_Internal Certificate Authority(CA)

*Policies:
ISE services are controlled through policies:
_Authentication, Authorization, Posture, Profile, etc...
_Policies consist of rules that are generally processed top-down*
_Default Rule (if exists) acts as a catch-all

Policies and/or Policy Rules are made of two types of Policy Elements:
_Conditions: matching critirea
_Results: Actions

ISE offers a large set of predefined Policy Elements:
_Policy ==> Policy Elements(Vary depending on the policy type)
_The structure of most elements is well-defined through Dictionaries:
Policy ==> Policy Elements ==> Dictionaries
Catalogs of objects ISE understands, their attributes & allowed values (System vs User)
Some elements come from external sources: Posture Updates
Useful Policy Conditions can be stored in the Library (Condition studio)
Policy ==> Policy Elements ==> Conditions ==> Library Conditions

Policy Sets:
Logical grouping of Authentication & Authorization policies:
_Default in ISE 2.3+
_Simplify policy structure: seperate sets for wired/wireless/guest/etc. access
_Processing:
Policy-set-level rule are evaluated first (top-down) until a match ==> the default set is checked last
For the set to be processed, Allowed Protocols must be met ==> Rules within the processed set follow top-down first-match evaluation
_Available for network access & device administration

Authentication Policy:
_Successful Authentication (PASS) leads to Authorization
_Failure Scenarios(FAIL):(Authentication failed, User not found, Process failed)
_Failover options: Reject/Drop/Continue

Authorization (AuthZ)Policy:
_Determines access to the network/device:
Authorization Policy Types:(Standard/Exception)
_Exception rules take precedence over Standard rules:
Top-down, first-match
The 'Multiple Matched' options is deprecated since 2.3
_A matching rule returns an Authorization Profile: set of permissions to be enforced on the session

Authorization Policy:
_Policy Enforcement Methods:
Downloadable ACL(dACL)
VLAN Segmentation
Web authentication: Central/Loan
Security Group Tag (SGT)
Any other RADIUS AV Pairs(including VSAs): MACsec Policy, Reauthentication, Smartport Macros & more

*Integrating Active Directory
_Prerequisites:
ISE Super/System User account
Time synchronization(NTP)
Port openings(DNS, MS-RPC, Kerberos, LDAP&LDAP[GC], NTP, IPC)

*AAA
Authentication:Verifying and providing Identity(password, token, biometric)
Authorization:Privileges, access level/ scope, etc...
Accounting is a process of tracking and recording activities(logs and timestamps)

AAA Security:
_AAA could be deployed directly on Network Access Devices(NADs)
Not scalable, limited AAA functionality
Centralized AAA is only possible with RADIUS or TACACS+
A client device (NAD) does AAA with a RADIUS/TACACS+ server

_TACACS and RADIUS
Primary Purpose: network access(R) <-> device administration(T)
Transport: UDP 1812/1813 or 1645/1646(R) <-> TCP 49 (T)
Security: user password (R) <-> entire payload (T) encryption
Protocol Design: authC + authZ(R) <-> seperate AAA functions (T)
Standardization: industry standard (R) <-> Cisco proprietary (T)
EAP support: yes(R) <-> no (T)

AAA security Protocols
RADIUS & TACACS+ exchange the client-server info using Attributes:
_Each attribute is designed to carry a certain type of info (Value is the data)
_TACACS+ attributes & values (AVs) are both strings defined by cisco

RADIUS Attributes:
_Supports 255 possible main numbered attributes (most IETF pre-defined)
_Vendor Specific Attribute (VSA) allows vendors to carry proprietary data{
	_VSA is IETF attribute 26 & consists of a Vendor Type, ID & Length
	_Cisco AV-Pair(Vendor ID 9, Type 1) is a well-known Cisco's VSA originally created to extend basic RADIUS functionality with some TACACS+ capabilities
protocol: attribute=value
shell:priv-level=15
}

Authentication(AuthC):

_A process of verifying an identity:
Commonly authenticated services:
IEEE 802.1x(dotx)
Enable password (enable)
Login (login) to activate a custom list use login authentication under a line

_Fallback Authentication:
More than one method can be defined (backup): 
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local

Authorization (AuthZ):
A process of enforcing a policy:
_Commonly authorized services(network/exec/shell/commands)
_Console access is not authorized unless aaa authorization console

EXEC Authorization:
Controls access to the CLI Shell: YES/NO
Shell attributes(Privilege Level, CLI view, Autocommand)

*Profiling: ISE uses Profiling for endpoint detection & classification and relies on Probes & Policies to collect endpoint attributes and profiling policies to analyze attributes to determine the endpoint's profile

Process:
Analysis of the recieved network traffic(RADIUS, SNMP, DHCP) and extraction of profiling data(Attributes/ Addresses/ MAC, IP), updates database and evaluates the attributes against profiling policies

Profiling Policies:
Similar to IPS signatures and consist of Rules, if condition then actions(Increase certainty factor[CF], Network Scan, Exception)
Policy selection based on the highest total certainty factor and rules increase with CF(for the child policy to be selected its parent must match as well)

Policy match and profile assignment, if none policy was matched, the endpoint gets profiled as 'UNKNOWN', Identity group assignment for mac addresses management and blacklisting

CoA(change of authorization):
Standards-based(RFC 3576) RADIUS improvement: allows a radius server to send unsolicited messages to its clients (NDAs), critical for profiling, posture, etc...(new endpoint attributes may result in re-profiling & different AuthZ rule)

Configuration:
_Wired: client under aaa radius dynamic-author
_Wireless: support for CoA under Security ==> RADIUS ==> Authentication

CoA & Profiling:
_ISE profiler issues CoA(if enabled) under certain events: endpoint profiled for the first time, endpoint deleted from the database.

CoA Profiling Settings:
_Global ==> Enable/Disable CoA for profiling(off by default)
_Per-profile ==> Overrides the global CoA action in a given policy(requires CoA to the globally enabled)

CoA Actions:
_Port Bounce simulates a link change(shutdown, no shutdown)
_Reauthenticate when a new authentication with the same session IDalso used instead of 'Port Bounce' when 2+ MACs were detected on a port

Profiling Probes:
_Software collecting & analyzing network data for profiling also several probes exist to collect different attributes(RADIUS, SNMP, HTTP, etc...). Most Probes are passive and traffic must be delivered to ISE
_Probes are useful if the collected data can be bound to an endpoint as full mac-ip address bindings are always desirable(http, dns and netflow)

RADIUS Probe:
_Originally used to gather Mac & ip address information(calling-station-id, MAC)
_Framed-IP-Address(Accounting packets) ==> IP
_RADIUS Probe is commonly deployed along with Device Sensor

Device Sensor:
_Enables a switch/WLC to include additional profiling attributes
_inside of RADIUS accounting packets(cdp, lldp, dhcp) recommended for scaling the development
_configuration(switch):turn on RADIUS accounting, accounting VSA, CDP/LLDP & DHCP snooping, enable with device-sensor accounting & device-sensor notify all-changes, verify with show device-sensor cache

SNMP Probe:Recommended if Device Sensor is not supported
_TRAP: Sent by NAD to ISE on a link up/down event and capable of collecting MAC address if MAC Notifications were enabled
_QUERY:Sent by ISE to NAD to fetch CDP/LLDP/ARP data, in response to SNMP TRAp or RADIUS accounting packet, periodically, during network scan(NMAP)

DHCP Probe:Useful to capture IP-MAC address bindings & OS information
_DHCP(no SPAN):
Requires DHCP packets to be sent to ISE and accomplished using a relay agent[ip helper-address]
_DHCP(SPAN): might be hard to deploy and cause replication issues

HTTP probe:Main source of the OS information HTTP request (User agent)
_HTTP(no SPAN): Requires HTTP packet to be sent to ISE portals and traffic will be profiled even if the Probe is disabled
_HTTP SPAN: Commonly deployed in the Internet Edge and be too resource-intensive

_DNS: Acquires FQDN based on a reverse DNS lookup

_Active Directory: Extracts AD-related information(windows systems)

_Netflow:Profiles endpoints based on flow characteristics rather than attributes, netflow data may quickly oversubscribe a PSN, Only use flexible netflow v9 along with a filtering solution

_NMAP:Active mechanism communicating directly with an endpoint, TCP/UDP ports scans including snmp walk, activation is either manual or dynamic. Manual(ip host, subnet), Dynamic(Profiling policy 'Take network scan')

802.1x:
L2 authentication standard (IEEE) for wired & wireless networks used for identity-based networking and implemented through EAP (EAP over LAN 'EAPOL') and framework for exchanging arbitrary authentication data

_802.1x components
supplicant and client software
authenticator and policy enforcement(switch/access point/wlc)
authentication server (RADIUS)

_802.1x authentication
Authenticator drops non-EAPOL frames before/during AuthC, cisco switches add exceptions for STP, CDP & LLDP
Authentication process starts on reception of a EAP request identity frame and sent on link up/wireless connection or upon reception of EAP start, Authenticator acts as a proxy between supplicant & RADIUS server, EAP data is extracted & encapsulated using two RADIUS EAP-specific attributes.
Authentication method is negotiated followed by authentication
Authentication results determine network access rights, success allow access + return optional AuthZ data (dACL/VLAN), Failure(Access-reject-EAP failure)
==> wireless no access
==> wired no access(reauthenticate after dot1x timeout quiet-period, next authentication method, auth-fail vlan)

MAB(MAC authentication bypass):
_An alternative authentication method for 802.1x environments needed for non-supplicant devices(ip cameras, printers, etc)
_MAB details if enabled (mab), triggers after 802.1x times out (dot1x timeout tx-period) in wireless for WLANs configured with MAC filtering, Processed as 'Host Lookup', No password verification, authC based on presence of MAC address, Identified via RADIUS service-type 10 (Call-check) & NAS-Port-Type (15eth) (19 wireless)

Flexible Authentication:
Cisco's 802.1x enhancement for wired deployments:
single configuration that fits all 802.1x authentication scenarios, authentication method list (ordered), authentication order [dot1x][mab][webauth]
==>failed authentication fallback
authentication event fail action next-method
==>Authentication method preference
authentication priority [dot1x][mab][webauth]

Deploying 802.1x:
.Cisco allows to deploy 802.1x in modes(phases) such as monitoring mode and Low Impact and/or closed
.Wireless 802.1x is 'binary' and cannot be phased(no monitor or low impact modes)
_Monitor Mode: Enables 802.1x authentication but without affecting users/endpoints, provides full visibility to the devices connecting to the network, allows to address any authentication issues prior to moving the next deployment
_Monitor Mode components: Flexible authentication & MAB, Multi-Auth Port Mode, RADIUS accounting(802.1x), Open Authentication, profiling
.Low impact mode:
_Provides partial network access prior to authentication, useful for preboot execution environments(PXEs), diskless workstations, etc...
_Low-impact mode builds on top of the monitor mode:
Open authentication is still critical, Pre-authentication ACL, DHCP and DNS, Microsoft ports for machine authentication (kerberos, LDAP, etc...)

_closed Mode:
Works like original 802.1x: No data traffic is allowed before successful authentication, Perfect for VLAN-based segmentation(No ip address is assigned prior to authentication)
Changes from the monitor mode: Open authentication must be disabled, VLANs must exist prior to assignment(Including WLC subinterfaces)

Main Configuration consideration(ISE):

_For Monitor mode: 
.Successful authentication for unknown endpoints('Continue' action)
.User/device specific authorization rules
.No authorization profiles (dACL, VLAN)

_Low-Impact Mode:
.Authorization rule tuning
.Authorization profiles

_Closed Mode:
.Authentication rules for wireless MAB & 802.1x
.Authorization rule tuning(Authorization profiles)

_Using Network Device Group(NDGs) may help in any deployment, one for each mode and seperated policy sets(Low-impact, monitor, closed).
