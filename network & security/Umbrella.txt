Umbrella offers an advanced recursive DNS service: Secure, DNS inspection, cloud based, consolidates security services at one place despite of the recent "decentralized network" trend, fast and highly resilient, extensive BGP peerings and anycast routing.
_Packages: Cisco Umbrella(DNS Security Essentials, DNS Security Advantage), Cisco Umbrella SIG(Secure Internet Gateway essentials)

Deployment Options:

DNS traffic can be redirected to Umbrella in several ways:
On-network:
_internal DHCP ==> locations with no internal domain(s)
_internal DNS ==> Some endpoints may need to be configured manually
_Umbrella Virtual Appliance
_Network devices

Roaming & Mobile:
_Umbrella Roaming Client
_AnyConnect Umbrella module
_Cisco Security Connector(iOS agent)

Umbrella Virtual Appliance(VA):

Lightweight virtual machine for VMware, AWS, Azure..., works as a conditional DNS forwarder, recieves all client DNS queries, only public/external DNS queries go to Umbrella

Virtual Appliance Advantages:

Extended DNS (EDNS):
Device & Organization ID, client's IP enhanced visibility & granular policies (public IP address does not matter)

Easy AD integration:
Adds user/group information
Encryption (DNSCrypt) & Authentication

Policies:

Umbrella enforces security & access controls through Policies:
_A policy points to at least one identity
_Policies are evaluated top-down: only the first policy matching the identity gets executed.
_Default Policy is a catch-all (applies to all identities)

Policy engines:
DNS Layer Security / Content Inspection / Application Inspection / File Analysis / Destination Lists.

Umbrella seperates DNS traffic to categories:
Malware / Newky seen domains / Command Control Callbacks / Phishing Attacks / Dynamic DNS / Potentially harmful domains / DNS tunneling VPN / Cryptomining

Content & Application Inspection:
Allows to block traffic to non-malware sites based on content or application category, Content category levels, high moderate low & custom.
Application Categories: Social Networking, games, P2P ...

Allows to scan files hosted on 'risky' websites:

_Umbrella resolves a 'risky' website to the ip of intelligent proxy, intelligent proxy must be enabled
_The proxy passes the file to AMP & anti-virus engines for inspection (only files deemed to be clean are returned to the user)

Using SSL decryption enhances file inspection(certain websites won't be proxied (and inspected) without it).

Intelligent proxy:

_Extends DNS-layer protection to the session level, allows for selective traffic interception(standard ports), gray/risked domains, proxied website resolves to the ip address of the intelligent proxy.Traffic to known good/bad sites is handled at the DNS level.

_Addresses important concerns related to traditional proxies:
Scalability, Cloud based service
Off-network protection
Speed and user experience, selective proxying

SSL Decryption:
Recommended for Intelligent Proxy deployments:

_works for proxy-intercepted traffic only
_allows to inspect HTTPS traffic, certain domains my be bypassed through selective decryption
_Improves behavior of other features: Custom URL Blocking or File inspection

SSL Decryption requires installation of the Cisco's Root certificate
