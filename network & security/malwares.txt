CIA Triad:
Confidentiality: encryption(Hiding data from unauthorized individuals/systems)
Integrity: Aims to prevent data from being corrupted
Availability: Ensures that data continues to be available at a required level

Common Attack methods:
Reconnaissance(network discovery)
Social Engineering (fouling/tricking)
Privilege Escalation(getting more access)
Code Execution(activating malicious code)
Backdoors(software installed to allow remote access in the future)
Covert channels(hidden communication channel)

Attack detection strategies:
Signatures: Set of rules/conditions describing an attack(must be already known and signatures must be kept up-to-date)
Anomaly Detection: Initially learns patterns of normal network activities(baseline profile) constantly compared to current activities
Policy-Based: Traffic detected outside the configured policy triggers an alarm(configuring a policy might be challenging and time consuming)
Reputatuion-Based: Traffic is evaluated based on reputation IP addresses, URLs domains

Malware(Malicious software) such as:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer Virus				|	Worms
Mailer					|	Logic bombs
Exploits				|	Backdoor
Spammer					|	Keyloggers
Rootkits				|	Ransomeware

Computer Virusis a malicious software that infects a host file or system area to perform undesirable outcomes such as erasing data, stealing info, corrupting integrity of the system, attached to executable file .exe and not activated until exec is run

Worm is virus that replicate themselves over the network infecting numerous vulnerable systems. In most occasions, a worm will execute malicious instructions on remote system without user interaction.

Endpoint protection:
Firewalls, Routers, switches, antivirus, antispyware, malware analysis and protection, personal firewalls, data & email encryption, VPN.

Exploits:
_Unintentional holes left in software that malicious actors can use to their advantage.
_Exploits are classified by the type of vulnerability that can be exploited.
_Spammer: Malware designed to create and distribute spam.
_Keyloggers: Malware designed to capture, and transmit, all of your keystrokes on your keyboard with the intent of obtaining passwords, PINs, etc.
_Rootkits: Malware designed to provide administrator access to your OS so it can:
Scan machine's traffic ==> install other programs ==> hijack computer resources ==> ensalve the computer in a botnet


Anti: antivirus, antimalware, antispyware software is the first line of defense within a host should be antivirus/malware program.
Detection:
	==> signature detection based(known patterns for malwares)
	==> Heuristic detection(looking at the code of files for suspicious properties)
	==> Behavioral based detection (looking for suspicious behavior as files are allowed to run)

Cisco AMP: Cisco advanced malware protection uses a mix of preventive engines and cloud based intelligence updated by Cisco Talos and Cisco Threat grid
Cisco AMP provides a central, administrator's dashboard to gain overall visibility into the health of your endpoints.

Personal Firewalls are network firewalls are typically implemented as hardware appliances that are placed at network security boundaries and designed to protect traffic to/from entire network(subnets)
	==> Implemented as a software solutions on hosts 
	==> Often come integrated into the OS
	==> Persuasive use across all hosts can constitute a "Distributed Firewall"
	==> Block unauthorized access to your computer
	==> Permit authorized data commuications to and from your computer
	==> Rules and exception are applied to all inbound and outbound traffic
	==> Rules can configurable. New rules can be added.
	==> Rules can vary depending on the type of network you are connected to corporate network, public network and home network

HIPS(Host Intrusion prevention system) is a software packages that monitor a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occuring within that host. Malware can be difficult to spot purely based on signatures. HIPS objective is to stop malware by monitoring the behavior of the code. HIPS is typically configured to pause the activity of suspected code, and prompt the user for a decision based on configure rulesets.



Mitigation Tools:
Access Lists(ACL):
Acess List is an example of simple packet filtering tech

_Mainly used to control traffic to/through the device, often used by other features such as Route filtering, QoS or VPN

_Consists of Access Control Entries (ACEs) processed sequentially in a top-down fashion, each numbered entry consits of an action(permit or deny) and conditions such as source ip destination ip port numbers protocols
ACL types:
Standard ACL(1->99) also can be named useless for traffic filtering
Extended ACL(100-199) allows to match any supported condition.

Traffic-filtering ACLs must be applied to activate them
There can be only one ACL applied on an interface per direction(in or out)
An outbound ACL does not affect the traffic generated by the device

IOS vs ASA:
ACL uses wildcard (IOS) or regular (ASA) network masks
Inbound ACL controls transit (ASA) or to and through the box (IOS) traffic
