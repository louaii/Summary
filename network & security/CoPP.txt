CoPP(Control Plane Policing):
The primary function of CoPP is to protect a router's CPU:

_Large number of process-switched packets can affect normal router functions
_CoPP allows to rate-limit or drop packets destined to the CPU, including ipv6
_Also allows to control traffic generated by the router

Examples of process-switched packets:

_Receive-adjacency to the router traffic such as Management Plane packets or broadcasts
_Data Plane Exceptions, packets that require specialized handling(traffic matching acl, packets with ip, low ttl, non-ip packets)

Configuration of CoPP is defined through Modular QoS CLI (MQC):

_Class Maps(class-map) are used for traffic classification
_Policy Map(policy-map) specifies actions for individual classes
_The Policy is activated via service-policy [input|output] under control-plane

Classification Options
_Access-List
_Network-Based Application Recognition(NBAR) only for PPP and ARP
_ToS(DSCP an IP Precedence)

Control Plane Protection(CPPr) is an extension of CoPP
_Offers more selective classification of CPU-destined packets, Divides control Plane into three subinterfaces(Host, Transit, CEF exception)
_Provides additional functionality (Port filtering and Queue thresholding)

Limitaions:
_No control over router-generated packets
_No ipv6 support
_Requires CEF (ip cef)

CPPr subinterfaces:

_Host: Router destined traffic that is not CEF Exception, Management packets, EIGRP, IP fragments, other receive-adjacency packets

_Transit: Transit IP traffic that is software-switched, packets logged by an ACL

_CEF Exception: CEF-redirected packets to the CPU, TTL-1 packets like OSPF, CDP, ARP, L2 keepalives, other non-IP traffic

Port filtering:

_Information about ports opened/closed on a router is maintained at the process-level, results in an exploitable attack vector
_Port filtering provides early dropping of packets destined to closed UDP/TCP ports, once enabled a dynamic table of open ports is created and maintained.

Queue Thresholding:
Limits a number of packets a protocol may have in the control plane input queue
