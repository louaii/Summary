Port-Security: on switches
To prevent a CAM table overflow attack on a switch and limit the mac-addresses readable by ports.(Dynamic, Static, Sticky)
Dynamic: whenever an endpoint is connected to the switch, it has the authorization to operate
Static: Port are defined manually to each mac address
Sticky: Whenever an endpoint is connected to the switch, it's mac address will be copied to the switch and no other mac address can connect to that port
Violation actions:
In case of violation the switch will take action for the malicious port between these:
Protect: Whenever the number of mac addresses exceded by the number given to the switch, the switch will drop these frames
Restrict: The same as Protect but also takes care of logs and information about these violation(SNMP, SYSLOG, counter)
Shutdown port:In default setup, shutdown is selected whenever a restriction occurs and also takes care of logs just like the Restrict option
Shutdown VLAN:Same as shutdown port but instead of turning off the port, it will turn off the vlan for this port
It should be either trunk port or access port(Not both at the same time as dynamic port)
