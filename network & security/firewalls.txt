Firewalls:
Stateless firewall: primarly operates at layer3(network) and investigates each packet as a single individual based on rules and policies configured on the firewall. It's faster but less secure than the Statefull firewall.
Statefull firewall: operates at layer 3 and 4(network and transport) takes decisions based on connections and unauthorized traffics. This type of firewall is faster but still lowers the speed of traffic.
Firewalls configuration steps:
Identify Zones(add interface)
Identify Traffic(class maps)
Identify Action(Policy maps)
Identify the zones involved(Zone pair)
Specify the policy to use on the zone pair(Service policy)

ASA Firewall:(Adaptive Security Appliance Firewall) 
Security level goes from higher to lower only
ASDM is the graphical user interface for the ASA

firewall is a software/hardware system that acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
_Stateless ==> packet filtering
_Stateful ==> session information is maintained in a connection/stable table, return traffic is automatically allowed, capable of detecting certain attacks.

*Firewall technologies:
.Application layer gateways:
==>Designed to control certain type of traffic
==>full protocol visibility(packet inspection)[WSA, ESA]

*Transparent:
==>Operates at layer 2

*Next Generation:
_A combination stateful firewall and IPS
_Prevents threats[ASA]

**ASA firewall:
_next-generation firewall stateful filtering and application layer inspection
_VPN gateway: IKEv1/IKEv2 L2L and SSL remote access
_Next-generation IPS: ASA with FirePOWER, Advanced malware protection and reputation URL filtering
_Virtualization: Contexts
_High availability: Failover and clustering

*ASA Interfaces:
_physical(physifname): single port
_redundant(redundant nr): two ports(active/standby)
_etherchannel(interface port-channel nr): two or more ports(active/active)

*ASA NAT:
Typically to hide private IP addresses(RFC 1918)
types:
_Static(one to one, fixed pre-configured mapping)
_Dynamic(one to one, new IP address is allocated dynamically from a pool)
_PAT(many-to-one, source IP address and source port is changed dynamically)
_Static PAT(many-to-one, address & port mapping is pre-configured)
_Policy NAT(any condition-based translation)

NAT rule describes the packet before and after the translation:
_When a translation occurs(original packet)
_How it occurs(new/translated packet)

XLATEs:
_Stores current translations
_Primarily used to de-translate(restore the original) packet

AUTO NAT:
_Supports source IP address translation only(with an optional source port)
_Does not support Policy NAT or destination IP address translation
_Configured within a network object(object network) with NAT

Manual NAT:
_Commonly used for policy nat or twice nat(source & destination on IP translation)
_Implemented through global configuration mode nat(applied on objects and objects-group)

ASA modes of operation:
_Firewall Mode controls ASA's forwarding behavior
_Context Mode enables/disables firewall virtualization
_Both Modes affect features supported on the ASA

Firewall Mode: Routed Layer 3
_ASA acts as a Layer 3 hop, each interface connects to a different layer 3 subnet

Firewall Mode:Transparent
ASA acts as a L2 switch, bridged interfaces are grouped and put into one L3 network
.Multiple bridge-groups can be configured that cannot communicate to each other
_Unsupported features: VPNs, dynamic routing protocols, multicast routing and QoS
_Advantages:
.Can be easily placed into the network without having to re-address existing devices
.Allows to control non-IP packets
_Configure with firewall transparent:
.Configure a BVI interface for management(interface bvi nr)
.Associate interfaces with a bridge-group (bridge-group nr)

_Context Mode: Single(default)
.No virtualization: one firewall and one policy
.Supports all regular features

_Context Mode: Multiple
.Enables virtualization
 ==> Multiple logical firewall instances can co-exist on a single physical unit
 ==> Each of the virtual firewalls is configured with a set interfaces and policy 
.Does not support certain VPN protocols and features, QoS, multicast routing and some routing protocols
.Configure with mode multiple and then context 

_Failover:
.Requires two physical firewalls
.Active forwards traffic
.Works in one of two modes: Active-Standby or Active-Active(Availble in multiple context only)
.Stateful failover can be configured regardless of the failover mode

_Clustering:
.Combines multiple ASA into a single unit 
==> Results in increased throughput and redundancy
.Upstream and downstream routers are responsible for traffic load-balancing
==> Spanned Etherchannel / Policy-Based routing / Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing

_MPF configuration rules control many of the ASA's features:
.Inspection engines, TCP Normalization, QoS and more
.Work on traffic permited by the firewall policy(access rules, default policy)
.Managed by MQC-like framework:
 ==> classification(class-map) / policy config(policy-map) / policy activation(service-policy) 

_Classification
.All traffic(match any)
.Access-list(match access-list)
.TCP/UDP ports (match[tcp|udp])
.ToS(match[dscp | precedence])
.RTP(match rtp)
.Tunnel group(match tunnel-group)
.Default protocols(match default inspection traffic)
 ==> Special condition used in a default mpf policy to match multiple protocols in a single class

_Policy configuration
.Classes are evaluated top-down and in certain cases more than one class can be a match
==> MPF policies are processed in a complex way including internal ASA rules
==> Using one policy with non-overlapping classes results in MQC-like processing
.Class-default match otherwise unclassified packets.

_Policy feature types(Actions)
.Inspection engines(inspect protocol [L7_policy_name])
.Connection settings and timeouts (set connection)
.TCP Normalization and state bypass (set connection advanced-options)
.QoS(police, priority, shape)
.Legacy IPS(ips) and FirePower(sfr)

_Policy activation:
.Per-interface (service-policy interface)
.Globally (service-policy global)
 ==> enables the policy for all interfaces
.Interface-level policies take precedence for overlapping classes

_Default MPF Policy(global_policy)
.Enabled globally
.Has one class(inspection_default) matching default ports (default-inspection-traffic)
 ==> this special class allows to use multiple inspection engines
.Enables inspection for several protocols, including DNS, FTP, TFTP, ESMTP...
