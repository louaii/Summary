VPN(Virtual private network) can connect to multiple networks to one LAN network within an encrypted tunnel. Data-in-motion can be protected by sending it through VPNs. Different types of vpn exist, some of which are designed to provide confidentiality and some don't

Types:
		-------------------------------------------------
		|VPN technologies(confidentials)		|
		|-----------------------------------------------|
		|PPTP(point to point tunneling)			|
		|L2F(Layer 2 forwarding)			|
		|L2TP(Layer 2 tunneling protocol)		|
		|GRE(Generic routing encapsulation)		|
		|(MPLS)Multiprotocol label switching		|

		-------------------------------------------------

_PPTP(Point to Point Tunneling Protocol): creates a secure tunnel between two endpoints over a public network allowing data to be transmitted securely.
_IPsec:(Internet Protocol Security) used to secure ip communications by authenticating and encrypting each packet
_IKev:(Internet Key Exchange)<version 1 or 2> designed to establish security associations and negotiate cryptographic keys between two parties(client and server VPN)

IPsec is a protocol securing communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in data stream.
IKE:Internet Key exchange
IKE phase 1:
Negotiate phase1 ==> Setup keys ==> Authenticate ==> SA tunnel ready(IKE phase 1)
Options IKE phase1:
Hashing: MD5/SHA
Authentication: PSK, RSA
Group: 1, 2, 5
Lifetime: nb of seconds
Encryption: DES, 3DES, AES
IKE phase 2:
Negotiate phase2 ==>Encryption, hashing, lifetime, PFS, IKE phase2 SA tunnel ready called IPsec Tunnel
Hashing: MD5/SHA HMAC (Already authenticated)
Group/PFS (DH): 1, 2, 5
Lifetime: time or data 
Encryption: DES, 3DES, AES

Site to site vpn:
	==>Typically implemented on network infrastructure devices as the vpn endpoints  	
	==> Used to establish VPN tunnels between two or more organizations
	==> Transparent to end users

Remote-access vpns
	==> Enable end users to securely connect to remote , corporate resources when working from home
	==> require special software for ipsec or be browser based (ssl/tls)


SSL VPNS steps:
1 ==> SYN (server)
2 ==> SYN,ACK (client)
3 ==> ACK (server)
4 ==> Client SSL Hello, lists of ciphers (server)
5 ==> Server ssl hello certificate done (client)
6 ==> Ack(server)
7 ==> client key exchange change cipher spec(begin to encrypt) (server)
8 ==> change cipher spec (begin to encrypt)(client)
9 ==> encrypted ssl session established (client)(server)
