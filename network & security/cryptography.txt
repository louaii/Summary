Encryption: is the process of converting the plain text into unreadable text based on algorithm created for this encyption
Keys: public key and private key are required in asymetrical encryption to be able to convert the cipher text into a plain so the data can be readable.
Symetric encryption is an encryption that requires one key for decryption
Hash: is used to check the integrity of data and no modifications has occured.
HMAC: Hashed based message authentication code.

cryptography is for encrypting data
cryptanalysis is for decrypting data
Hashing is used to check the integrity of data(not modified) and functions in one way can't be restored
HMAC(Hashed message authentication code): refers to a modified version of an existing hashing function[HMAC-MD5/ HMAC-SHA1], it prevents third party from modifying the hash itself and includes a shared key when calculating hash

*Symetric encryption:
Requires single key shared(static(same key used)/dynamic(each time used generates new key))
The underlying algorithm can be Block or Stream cipher:
_Block ==> encrypts word by word, fixed size(64b/128b).[DES, 3DES, AES]
_stream ==> encrpted by bit or byte.[RC4, SEAL]

*Asymmetric encryption:Requires 2 keys public and private keys[RSA, DSA, DH]

*NGE(Next Generation Encryption): Cisco's set of cryptographic standards believed to be secure now and in the near future.
