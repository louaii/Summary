subnetting:
1.convert the nb of networks to binary
==> 192.168.5.0 ===> 11000000.10101000.00000101.00000000
subnetting based on network recuirement if 192.168.0.5 for 5 hosts count the bits to reach 5
subnetting based on hosts recuirement if 25 hosts then count the bits on subnet mask to be able to form the number required.
